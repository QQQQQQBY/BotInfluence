## ‚ú® User/Bot Agent Attributes


We define five core attributes related to disinformation spread: interest community, trust threshold, dissemination tendency, social influence, and activation time.

The `UserBotAgentAttributes` folder contains the definitions of five types of user attributes.

'UserBotAgentAttributes/README. Md' shows this part in detail. [<a href="UserBotAgentAttributes/README.md">readme</a>]

## üê£ Disinformation and Dissemination Rules

We set disinformation by community and plausibility. 

The 'Dataset/Disinformation' folder contains six topics we define types of disinformation, 'DisinformationRules/Prompt' folder shows us Prompt design on the rationality of evaluation of disinformation.

You can view the detailed readme file in the `DisinformationRules` folder. [<a href="DisinformationRules/README.md">readme</a>]

## ü¶ã Disinformation Dissemination Network

We combine the Stochastic Block Model (SBM)  and Barab√°si-Albert Model (BAM) to generate disinformation propagation networks.

`DisseminationNetwork` folder contains a potential network of spread that we produce a certain proportion of malicious bots and legitimate bots, and together with ordinary human accounts.

You can view the detailed readme file in the `DisseminationNetwork` folder. [<a href="DisseminationNetwork/README.md">readme</a>]

## ü™∏ Simulation

The execution code of our disinformation simulation based on the constructed MADD is presented in `SimulateExperiment`.
