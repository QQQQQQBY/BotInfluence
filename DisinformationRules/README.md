  🧟Disinformation Generation and Evaluation🧟
</p>

## ✨ Construction and Correction of Disinformation

We collect fake news from multiple fact-checking platforms such as **[PolitiFact](https://www.factcheck.org/), [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/) and [FactCheck](https://www.factcheck.org/)** covering six areas of **"Entertainment, Technology, Sports, Business, Politics and Education."**

Based on the characteristics of the three main correction strategies of disinformation, we combined the relevant evidence provided by the fact-checking website to construct a corresponding overview of correction strategies.

The above **Disinformation and its corresponding correction content** can be obtained in `Dataset/Disinformation/*yaml`.

## 🎮 Persuasive Assessment of Disinformation

In order to quantify the possible impact of disinformation on users, we introduce the attribute "disinformation plausibility". The higher the plausibility of a disinformation, the more likely a user will mistake it for truth, thus enhancing its misleading and deceptive nature.
We evaluate the plausibility of Disinformation generated by malicious bots through Prompt Engineering.

🏓 **Prompt Engineering:** Path: `Prompt/DisinformationPlausibility.yaml`

🎳 **Execuation Evaluation**: `python Disinformation_plausibility.py`
