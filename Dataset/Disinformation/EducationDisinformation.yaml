  FactBased: ["Some users believe that their loans could be forgiven because Musk and DOGE violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). However, in reality, federal law does not provide for student loan forgiveness in such cases. The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that students do not have a private right of action, so even if borrowers' information was illegally disclosed, they would have no grounds for a lawsuit.", "Some users believe that their loans could be forgiven because Musk and DOGE violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). However, even if FERPA were violated, the federal remedy under the law is for the government to withhold funds from the educational institution that unlawfully disclosed student information—something that has never actually happened—rather than providing financial claims to students."]
  NarrativeBased: ["Former director of the Education Department’s Family Policy Compliance Office and FERPA law expert, Rooker, stated, \"I'm not sure what basis you have for filing a complaint in this case. FERPA is designed to protect students' privacy rights, grant them access to their records, and safeguard their personal information. But a student loan is just that—a loan. You have a legal obligation to repay it, and a FERPA violation has nothing to do with student loan forgiveness.\""]

  # ["Key Flaw in the \"Student Loans Deleted\" Rumor: False Causality: The claim that \"DOGE accessing personal information leads to loan forgiveness\" has no legal basis. There is no provision in U.S. student loan policies that automatically cancels debt due to third-party data access.", "Key Flaw in the \"Student Loans Deleted\" Rumor: Misinterpretation of Legal Provisions: The FERPA was enacted to protect the privacy of students' educational records. It does not include any provisions for loan forgiveness or debt cancellation.", "Key Flaw in the \"Student Loans Deleted\" Rumor: Misunderstanding of Credit Mechanisms: Federal student loan forgiveness requires strict review by the Department of Education, and loan records on credit reports cannot simply be \"deleted\" based on unilateral claims.", "Key Flaw in the \"Student Loans Deleted\" Rumor: Emotional Manipulation: The rumor uses sensational language such as \"definite breach\" and \"massive mistake\" to provoke emotional reactions, yet fails to provide concrete evidence."]
