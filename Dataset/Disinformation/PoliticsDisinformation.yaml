  FactBased: ["The House Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol publicly released a final 845-page report and more than 100 transcripts of testimony, along with memos, depositions and documents. Much of the committee’s work remains available online.", "House Republicans in March 2024 released a report accusing the committee of suppressing and deleting some pieces of evidence, but they have not gone as far as Trump in claiming that \"all\" evidence was destroyed."]
  NarrativeBased: ["The House committee members, consisting of seven Democrats and two Republicans, stated that certain videos and sensitive materials were excluded from the official record to protect witnesses. All other materials were properly preserved, including over 100 testimony transcripts, written depositions, and documents that remain publicly available online.", "Loudermilk wrote to Committee Chairman Thompson, stating that certain committee materials had not been archived. Chairman Thompson responded that the materials provided to the executive branch contained \"law enforcement-sensitive operational details and private personal information which, if released, could compromise witness safety.\""]
  LiteracyBased: ["Media Literacy Tips: ✔ Spot absolute claims (\"ALL,\" \"everything\") — they're often red flags for exaggeration. ✔ Verify archive status through primary sources (e.g., National Archives, House.gov). ✔ Contextualize omissions — sensitive materials are routinely withheld for security reasons, not \"deleted.\" ✔ Cross-check partisan reports — note differences between Trump's rhetoric and GOP investigators' actual findings."]
