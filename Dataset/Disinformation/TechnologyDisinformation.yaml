EMF claimed that by 2050 the oceans would contain 850 million tons of plastic versus 812 million tons of fish", "While plastic has revolutionised our way of life since it was invented in the 1950s, the problem is that most of the plastic that’s been made still exists. The amount of plastic in the ocean is expected to double in the next 15 years, and it’s estimated that by 2050, there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish (by weight). EMF claimed that by 2050 the oceans would contain 850 million tons of plastic versus 812 million tons of fish", "Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) claimed that by 2050 the oceans would contain 850 million tons of plastic versus 812 million tons of fish"]

  FactBased: ["The 2023 study, \"A growing plastic smog, now estimated to be over 170 trillion plastic particles afloat in the world's oceans—Urgent solutions required\" found that the weight of plastic in the world's oceans is significantly lower by 1.1 to 4.9 million tons compared to the 2050 estimate by EMF.", "Further study \"Predicting Consumer Biomass, Size-Structure, Production, Catch Potential, Responses to Fishing and Associated Uncertainties in the World’s Marine Ecosystems\" found fish biomass could be billions of tons, rather than millions"]
  NarrativeBased: ["The author of the plastics study, Jenna Jambeck, told the BBC that she was not confident in the numbers in her study being projected forward the way the EMF had done so.", " Simon Jennings, the lead author of the 2008 fish study, conducted another study in 2015 that estimated fish biomass in the billions of tons rather than the millions used in the EMF report."]
