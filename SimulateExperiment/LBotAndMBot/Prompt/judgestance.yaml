  Perform binary consistency evaluation between two information units: [disinfo] (reference information) and [info] (questionable information). Output must be a strict binary value with justification. Response must strictly follow the [Output Format].

  [disinfo]: {original_info}
  [info]: {current_info}

  Evaluation Criteria:
  1. Core Claim Alignment:
    Compare the central assertions/claims of both texts
    Ignore stylistic differences and focus on factual propositions
  2. Contextual Consistency:
    Consider if [info] takes [disinfo] out of context

  Output Requirements:
  1. Pure JSON format (no Markdown, no additional text)

  [Output Format]:
  Required JSON Output Format:
  {{"consistency_score":Output 1 if consistent (supported), output 0 if opposed, 
  "reasoning": "brief_explanation"
  }}
